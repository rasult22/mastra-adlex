```
(a) to be interested in the PLC’s Shares; or
(b) to have been so interested at any time in the three (3) years preceding the date of such
notice.

33.2 The notice may require the person to confirm any interest that person has, or has had, in the
Shares and, to provide details relating to such interest as specified in the notice.

for the purpose of protecting the rights of the applicant or any third party, and subject to
such terms as it thinks fit, direct that:

(a) to the extent set out in the order, the acts of a person or persons (or category of persons)
do not constitute a contravention of the restrictions imposed under Regulation 33.4; or

restrictions.

```
```

make that disclosure; or

## PART 8 – PROTECTION OF MINORITIES IN TAKEOVERS

## 74. TAKEOVER OFFERS

```
74.1 In this Part 8, a “takeover offer” means an offer to acquire all the Shares, or all the Shares of
any class or classes, in a PLC (other than Shares which at the date of the offer are already
held by the offeror), being an offer on terms which are the same in relation to all the Shares to
which the offer relates or, where those Shares include Shares of different classes, in relation
to all the Shares of each relevant class.
```

```
74.2 In Regulation 74.1, “Shares” means Shares which:
(a) have been allotted on the date of the offer;
(b) that are subsequently allotted before a date specified in or determined in accordance
with the terms of the offer; and
(c) any rights convertible into shares before a date specified or determined in accordance
with the term of the offer.
```
```
74.3 The terms offered in relation to any Shares shall, for the purposes of this Regulation, be
treated as being the same in relation to all the Shares or, as the case may be, all the Shares
of a class to which the offer relates, notwithstanding any variation permitted by Regulation
74.4.
```
```
74.4 A variation is permitted where:
(a) the law of a country or territory outside the Free Zone precludes the acceptance of an
offer in that jurisdiction in the form or the forms specified, or precludes it except after
compliance by the offeror with conditions with which it is unable to comply or which it
regards as unduly onerous; and
(b) the variation is such that the persons by whom the acceptance of an offer in that
form is precluded are able to accept an offer in a different form but of substantially
equivalent value.
```
```
74.5 The reference in Regulation 74.1 to Shares already held by the offeror includes a reference to
Shares which the offeror has an unconditional right to acquire under an unconditional option
to acquire. Where the terms of an offer make provision for their revision and for acceptances
on the previous terms to be treated as acceptances on the revised terms, the revision shall
not be regarded for the purposes of this Part 8 as the making of a fresh offer and references
in this Part 8 to the date of the offer shall accordingly be construed as references to the date
on which the original offer was made.
```
```
74.6 In this Part 8, the “offeror” means, subject to Regulation 80, the person making a takeover
offer, and is applicable to PLCs.
```
## 75. RIGHT OF OFFEROR TO BUY OUT MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS

```
75.1 If, in a case in which a takeover offer does not relate to Shares of different classes, the offeror
has, by virtue of acceptances of the offer, acquired or contracted to acquire not less than
90% in value of the Shares to which the offer relates, the offeror may, within one hundred and
twenty (120) days of the close of the takeover offer, give notice to the holder of any Shares to
which the offer relates which the offeror has not acquired or contracted to acquire that the
offeror desires to acquire those Shares.
```
```
75.2 If, in a case in which a takeover offer relates to Shares of different classes, the offeror has,
by virtue of acceptances of the offer, acquired or contracted to acquire not less than 90%
in value of the Shares of any class to which the offer relates, the offeror may, within one
hundred and twenty (120) days of the close of the takeover offer, give notice to the holder of
any Shares of that class which the offeror has not acquired or contracted to acquire that the
offeror desires to acquire those Shares.
```
```
75.3 No notice shall be given under Regulations 75.1 or 75.2 unless the offeror has acquired or
contracted to acquire the Shares necessary to satisfy the minimum specified therein before
the end of the period of four (4) months beginning with the date of the offer, and no such
notice shall be given after the end of the period of two (2) months beginning with the date on
which the offeror has acquired or contracted to acquire Shares which satisfy that minimum.
```

75.4 When the offeror gives the first notice in relation to an offer, the offeror shall send a copy
of it to the PLC together with a declaration by the offeror stating that the conditions for
the giving of the notice are satisfied. A person who makes such a declaration must have
reasonable grounds for believing it to be true. An offeror which fails to comply with this
requirement is liable to a fine.

75.5 The declaration shall be signed by a Director of the PLC. A Director who makes such a
declaration without having reasonable grounds for believing it to be true is liable to a fine.

75.6 In a proceeding against a person for an alleged failure to send a copy of a notice as required
by Regulation 75.4, it is a defence for such a person to prove that the person took reasonable
steps for securing compliance with that Regulation.

75.7 Where, during the period within which a takeover offer can be accepted, the offeror acquires
or contracts to acquire any of the Shares to which the offer relates but otherwise than by
virtue of acceptances of the offer, then if:
(a) the value of that for which they are acquired or contracted to be acquired (the
“Acquisition Value”) does not, at that time, exceed the value of that which is receivable
by an acceptor under the terms of the offer; or
(b) those terms are subsequently revised so that when the revision is announced, the
Acquisition Value, at the time mentioned in Regulation 75.7(a), no longer exceeds the
value of that which is receivable by an acceptor under those terms,

the offeror shall be treated for the purposes of this Regulation as having acquired or
contracted to acquire those Shares by virtue of acceptances of the offer; but in any other
case those Shares shall be treated as excluded from those to which the offer relates.

## 76. EFFECT OF NOTICE UNDER REGULATION

76.1 The following provisions shall, subject to Regulation 79, have effect where a notice is given
in respect of any Shares under Regulation 75.

76.2 The offeror shall be entitled and bound to acquire those Shares on the terms of the offer.

76.3 Where the terms of an offer are such as to give the holder of any Shares a choice of payment
for such holder’s Shares, the notice shall give particulars of the choice and state:
(a) that the holder of the Shares may, within six (6) weeks from the date of the notice,
indicate such holder’s choice by a written communication sent to the offeror at an
address specified in the notice; and
(b) which payment specified in the offer is to be taken as applying in default of such holder
indicating a choice as aforesaid, and the terms of the offer mentioned in Regulation
76.2 shall be determined accordingly.

76.4 Regulation 76.2 applies whether or not any time-limit or other conditions applicable to the
choice under the terms of the offer can still be met. If the payment chosen by the holder of
the Shares:
(a) is not cash and the offeror is no longer able to make that payment; or
(b) was to have been made by a third party who is no longer bound or able to make that
payment, the payment shall be taken to consist of an amount of cash payable by the
offeror which, at the date of the notice, is equivalent to the chosen payment.

76.5 At the end of six (6) weeks from the date of the notice, the offeror shall forthwith:


```
(a) send a copy of the notice to the PLC; and
(b) make payment to the PLC on behalf of the holders for the Shares to which the notice
relates.
```
76.6 The copy of the notice sent to the PLC under Regulation 76.5(a) shall be accompanied by an
instrument of transfer executed on behalf of the Shareholder by a person appointed by the offeror.
On receipt of that instrument, the PLC shall register the offeror as the holder of those Shares.

76.7 Where the payment referred to in Regulation 76.5(b) is to be made in Securities to be issued
by the offeror, the reference in that Regulation to the making of payment shall be construed
as a reference to the issuance of such Securities to the PLC on behalf of the holders of the
Shares to which the notice relates.

76.8 Any sum or other payment received by a PLC under Regulation 76.5(b) shall not be the
property of the PLC but shall be held by the PLC on behalf of the person entitled to the
Shares in respect of which the sum or other payment was received.

76.9 Any sum received, including any dividend or other sum accruing from any other payment, by
a PLC under Regulation 76.5(b) shall be paid into a separate bank account, being an account
the balance of which bears interest at an appropriate rate and can be withdrawn by such
notice, if any, as is appropriate.

## BY OFFEROR 77. RIGHT OF MINORITY SHAREHOLDER TO BE BOUGHT OUT

77.1 If, in a case in which a takeover offer does not relate to Shares of different classes, at any
time before the end of the period within which the offer can be accepted:
(a) the offeror has, by virtue of acceptances of the offer, acquired or contracted to acquire
some (but not all) of the Shares to which the offer relates; and
(b) those Shares, with or without any other Shares in the PLC which the offeror has acquired
or contracted to acquire, amount to not less than nine-tenths (9 /10) in value of all the
Shares in the PLC, the holder of any Shares to which the offer relates who has not
accepted the offer may, by a written communication addressed to the offeror, require
the offeror to acquire those Shares.

77.2 If, a takeover offer relates to Shares of any class other than that referred to in Regulation 77.1
and, at any time before the end of the period within which the offer can be accepted:
(a) the offeror has, by virtue of acceptances of the offer, acquired or contracted to acquire
some (but not all) of the Shares of any class to which the offer relates; and
(b) those Shares, with or without any other Shares of that class which the offeror has
acquired or contracted to acquire, amount to not less than nine-tenths (9 /10) in value of
all the Shares of that class, the holder of any Shares of that class who has not accepted
the offer may, by a written communication addressed to the offeror, require the offeror
to acquire those Shares.

77.3 Within one (1) month of the time specified in Regulations 77.1 or 77.2, the offeror shall give
any Shareholder or holder of Shares of that class who has not accepted the offer a notice of
the rights setting out:
(a) the rights that are exercisable by that Shareholder or holder of Shares of that class
under that Regulation, as is relevant; and
(b) the period within which the rights are exercisable, and, if the notice is given before the
end of the period within which the offer can be accepted, it shall state that the offer is
still open for acceptance.


```
77.4 A notice under Regulation 77.3 may specify a period for the exercise of the rights conferred
by this Regulation, and in that event, the rights shall not be exercisable after the end of that
period. No such period shall end less than three (3) months after the end of the period within
which the offer can be accepted.
```
```
77.5 Regulation 77.3 does not apply if the offeror has given the Shareholder notice in respect of
the Shares in question under Regulation 75.
```
```
77.6 An offeror who fails to comply with the requirements in Regulations 77.3 or 77.4 is liable to a
fine.
```
```
77.7 In a proceeding against an offeror other than a PLC for an alleged failure to comply with the
requirements of this Regulation 77, it is a defence for such an offeror to prove that the offeror
took all reasonable steps for securing compliance with this Regulation.
```
## 78. EFFECT OF REQUIREMENT UNDER REGULATION

```
78.1 The following provisions shall, subject to Regulation 79, have effect where a Shareholder
exercises the Shareholder’s rights in respect of any Shares under this Regulation.
```
```
78.2 The offeror shall be entitled and bound to acquire those Shares on the terms of the offer or
on such other terms as may be agreed.
```
```
78.3 Where the terms of an offer are such as to give the holder of any Shares a choice of payment
for the holder’s Shares, the holder of the Shares may indicate the holder’s choice when
requiring the offeror to acquire them, in accordance with the terms specified in Regulation
75.3.
```
```
78.4 Regulation 78.3 applies whether or not any time limit or other conditions applicable to the
choice under the terms of the offer can still be met. If the payment chosen by the holder of
the Shares:
(a) is not cash and the offeror is no longer able to make that payment; or
(b) was to have been made by a third party who is no longer bound or able to make that
payment,
```
```
the payment shall be taken to consist of an amount of cash payable by the offeror which, at
the date when the holder of the Shares required the offeror to acquire them, is equivalent to
the chosen payment.
```
## 79. APPLICATIONS TO THE COURT

```
79.1 Where a notice is given under Regulation 75 to the holder of any Shares, the Court may, on
an application made by the holder within six (6) weeks from the date on which the notice
was given:
(a) order that the offeror shall not be entitled and bound to acquire the Shares; or
(b) specify the terms of acquisition different from those of the offer.
```
```
79.2 If an application to the Court under Regulation 79.1 is pending at the end of the period
mentioned in Regulation 76.5, then, unless otherwise ordered by the Court, that Regulation
shall not have effect until the application has been disposed of.
```
```
79.3 Where the holder of any Shares exercises the holder’s rights under Regulation 77, the Court
may, on an application made by such holder or the offeror, order that the terms on which the
offeror is entitled and bound to acquire the Shares shall be such as the Court thinks fit.
```

```
79.4 On an application made under Regulations 79.1 or 79.3, the Court may not require
consideration which is:
(a) a higher value than that specified in the notice containing the terms of the offer (“offer
value”) to be paid for the Shares to which the application relates, unless the holder of
the Shares shows that the offer value would be unfair; or
(b) a lower value than the offer value in the notice to paid for the Shares.
```
```
79.5 No order for costs or expenses shall be made against a Shareholder making an application
under Regulations 79.1 or 79.3 unless the Court considers:
(a) that the application was unnecessary, improper or vexatious; or
(b) there has been unreasonable conduct on such Shareholder’s part in conducting the
proceedings on the application.
```
```
79.6 Where a takeover offer has not been accepted to the extent necessary for entitling the
offeror to give notices under Regulations 75.1 or 75.2 the Court may, on the application of
the offeror, make an order authorising the offeror to give notices under that Regulation if
satisfied:
(a) that the offeror has, after reasonable enquiry, been unable to trace one (1) or more of
the persons holding Shares to which the offer relates;
(b) that the Shares which the offeror has acquired or contracted to acquire by virtue
of acceptances of the offer, together with the Shares held by the person or persons
mentioned in Regulation 79.6(a), amount to not less than the minimum specified in
Regulations 75.1 or 75.2; and
(c) that the terms offered are fair and reasonable, but the Court shall not make an order
under this Regulation unless it considers that it is just and equitable to do so having
regard, in particular, to the number of Shareholders who have been traced but who
have not accepted the offer.
```
## 80. JOINT OFFERS

```
80.1 A takeover offer may be made by two (2) or more persons jointly, and in that event, this Part
8 has effect with the following modifications.
```
```
80.2 The conditions for the exercise of the rights conferred by Regulations 75 and 77 shall be
satisfied by the joint offerors acquiring or contracting to acquire the necessary Shares jointly
(as respects acquisitions by virtue of acceptances of the offer) and either jointly or separately
(in other cases); and, subject to the following provisions, the rights and obligations of the
offeror under those Regulations 76 and 78 shall be respectively joint rights and joint and
several obligations of the joint offerors.
```
```
80.3 It shall be sufficient compliance with any provision of Regulations 83 and 85 requiring or
authorising a notice or other document to be given or sent by or to the joint offerors that it
is given or sent by or to any of them, except that the declaration required by Regulation 75.4
shall be made by all of them and signed by a Director of that PLC.
```
```
80.4 In Regulations 74, 76.7 and 81, references to the offeror shall be construed as references to the
joint offerors or any of them.
```
```
80.5 In Regulation 76.6, references to the offeror shall be construed as references to the joint
offerors or such of them as they may determine.
```

```
80.6 In Regulations 76.6 and 86.4(a), references to the offeror being no longer able to make the
relevant payment shall be construed as references to none of the joint offerors being able to
do so.
```
```
80.7 In Regulation 79, references to the offeror shall be construed as references to the joint offerors,
except that any application under Regulations 79.3 or 79.6 may be made by any of them.
The reference in Regulation 79.6(a) to the offeror having been unable to trace one (1) or more
of the persons holding Shares shall be construed as a reference to none of the joint offerors
having been able to do so.
```
## 81. ASSOCIATES

```
81.1 The requirements in Regulation 74.1 that a takeover offer shall extend to all the Shares, or all
the Shares of any class or classes, in a PLC shall be regarded as satisfied notwithstanding
that the offer does not extend to Shares which associates of the offeror hold or have
contracted to acquire. Subject to Regulation 74.2, Shares which any such associate holds
or has contracted to acquire, whether at the time when the offer is made or subsequently,
shall be disregarded for the purposes of any reference in this Part 8 to the Shares to which a
takeover offer relates.
```
```
81.2 Where, during the period within which a takeover offer can be accepted, any associate of the
offeror acquires or contracts to acquire any of the Shares to which the offer relates, then, if
the condition specified in Regulations 75.7(a) or 75.7(b) is satisfied in respect of those Shares,
such Shares shall be treated for the purpose of that Regulation as Shares to which the offer
relates.
```
```
81.3 In Regulations 77.1(b) and 77.2(b), the reference to Shares which the offeror has acquired or
contracted to acquire shall include a reference to Shares which any associate of the offeror
has acquired or contracted to acquire.
```
```
81.4 In this Regulation, “associate”, in relation to an offeror, means one (1) or more of the following:
(a) a nominee of the offer; or
(b) a Holding Company, Subsidiary or fellow Subsidiary of the offeror or a nominee of such
a Holding Company, Subsidiary or fellow Subsidiary; or
(c) a company in which the offeror is substantially interested.
```
```
81.5 For the purposes of Regulation 81.4(b), a PLC is a fellow Subsidiary of another company if
both are Subsidiaries of the same company but neither is a Subsidiary of the other.
```
```
81.6 For the purposes of Regulation 81.4(c), an offeror has a substantial interest in a company if:
(a) that company or its Directors are accustomed to act in accordance with the offeror’s
directions or instructions; or
(b) the offeror is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of one-third (1 /3) or more of the
voting power at General Meetings of that company; or
(c) the offeror owns or controls directly or indirectly more than twenty per cent (20%) of
the share capital of that company.
```
```
81.7 Where the offeror is an individual, the offeror’s associates shall also include the offeror’s
spouse and any child, step-child, or grandchild of the offeror.
```
